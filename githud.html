<h1 style="color:green;font-size:larger;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Git and GitHub Tutorial –
    Version Control for
    Beginners
    </b></h1>
    <h2 style="color:brown;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><b>Git and GitHub are two technologies that every
        developer should learn, irrespective of their eld.</b></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        If you're a beginner developer, you might think that these two terms
mean the same thing – but they're different.
<br>
<br>
This tutorial will help you understand what Git and version control
are, the basic Git commands you need to know, how you can use its
features to boost your work efciency, and how to extend these
features using GitHub.
<br>
This guide is beginner friendly, as the examples will be very easy to
understand. It will also be a generalized tutorial so anyone can
follow along no matter what your favorite programming language is.
For our project, we'll make a to-do list written in a text (txt) le. You
will see how we can use the features of Git to work on and create a
nal version of the list.
<h2 style="color:yellow">Prerequisites</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>A text editor of your choice (I will be using VS Code).</li>
<li>A GitHub account.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 style=font-size: aria-label="50px";:>What is Git? </h2>
<br>
Git is a version control system which lets you track changes you
make to your les over time. With Git, you can revert to various
states of your les (like a time traveling machine). You can also make
a copy of your le, make changes to that copy, and then merge these
changes to the original copy.
<br>
For example, you could be working on a website's landing page and
discover that you do not like the navigation bar. But at the same
time, you might not want to start altering its components because it
might get worse.
<br>
With Git, you can create an identical copy of that le and play
around with the navigation bar. Then, when you are satised with
your changes, you can merge the copy to the original le.
You are not limited to using Git just for source code les – you can
also use it to keep track of text les or even images. This means that
Git is not just for developers – anyone can nd it helpful.
<br>
<h2><b> How to install Git</b></h2>
<br>
In order to use Git, you have to install it on your computer. To do
this, you can download the latest version on the ofcial website. You
can download for your operating system from the options given.
You can also install Git using the command line, but since the
Forum Donate
commands vary with each operating system, we'll focus on the:How to configure Git
I will assume that at this point you have installed Git. To verify this,
you can run this command on the command line: git --version .
This shows you the current version installed on you PC.
The next thing you'll need to do is to set your username and email
address. Git will use this information to identify who made specic
changes to les.
To set your username, type and execute these commands: git
config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME" and git config --
global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL" . Just make sure to replace
"YOUR_USERNAME" and "YOUR_EMAIL" with the values you choose.
How to Create and Initialize a
Project in Git
We are nally done with installing and setting up Git. It is now time
to create our project.
I have created a folder on my desktop called Git and GitHub
tutorial . Using the command line, navigate to your new project's
location. For me, I would run the following commands:
<ul>
<li> cd desktop </li>
<li> cd Git and GitHub tutorial </li>
</ul>
If you are new to the command line and are still learning how to use
it to navigate around your PC, then I would suggest using:
<br>
<br>
 <p align="center">git init</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 The rst line has information about my PC and the path to where
the folder exists. The second line is the command git init , and the
third line is the response sent back telling me that my repository
(repo) has been initialized. It is considered empty because we have
not told Git what les to track.
A repository is just another way to dene a project being
watched/tracked by Git.
<br>
<h2><b>Git project files
</b></h2>
<br>
I have created only one le called todo.txt . This is what the le
looks like:
MY TO-DO LIST
<ol>
<li> Write an article.</li>
<li> Code.</li>
<li> Study books.</li>
<li> Attend classes on time.</li>
<li> Visit aunt.</li>
<li> Apply for remote jobs.</li>
</ol> 
<br>
<h2><b>What is GitHub?</b></h2>
<br>
<br>
GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories. Imagine
working on a project at home and while you are away, maybe at a
friend's place, you suddenly remember the solution to a code error
that has kept you restless for days.
You cannot make these changes because your PC is not with you.
But if you have your project hosted on GitHub, you can access and
download that project with a command on whatever computer you
have access to. Then you can make your changes and push the latest
version back to GitHub.
In summary, GitHub lets you store your repo on their platform.
Another awesome feature that comes with GitHub is the ability to
collaborate with other developers from any location.
Now that we have created and initialized our project locally, let's
push it to GitHub.
If you are a beginner, you will come across some new terms like
push, commit, add, and so on – but do not be overwhelmed by them.
With some practice you will be able to remember these terms and
what they do.
<br>
<h2><b>How to push a repository to
    GitHub</b></h2>
    <br>
    I will divide this section into steps to help you understand how to create githud account.
    To be able to use GitHub, you will have to create an account first.
You can do that on their website.
<br>
  <h2><b>Step 2 – Create a repository</b></h2>
You can click on the + symbol on the top right corner of the page
then choose "New repository". Give your repo a name then scroll
down and click on "Create repository".
<h2><b>Step 3 – Add and commit file(s)</b></h2>
Before we "add" and "commit" our les, you need to understand the
stages of a le being tracked by Git.
<h3><b>Committed state</b></h3>
A le is in the committed state when all the changes made to the le
have been saved in the local repo. Files in the committed stage are
les ready to be pushed to the remote repo (on GitHub).
<h3><b>Modified state</b></h3>
A le in the modied state has some changes made to it but it's not
yet saved. This means that the state of the le has been altered from
its previous state in the committed state.
<h3><b>Staged state</b></h3>
A le in the staged state means it is ready to be committed. In this
state, all necessary changes have been made so the next step is to
move the le to the commit state.
You can understand this better by imagining Git as a camera. The
camera will only take a snapshot when the le reaches the commit staged and moved to the commit state for a new snapshot.
<br>
This might be a lot of information to take in at the moment, but do
not be discouraged – it gets easier with practice.
<br>
<h3><b>How to add files in Git</b></h3>
When we rst initialized our project, the le was not being tracked
by Git. To do that, we use this command git add . The period or
dot that comes after add means all the les that exist in the
repository. If you want to add a specic le, maybe one named
about.txt , you use git add about.txt .
Now our le is in the staged state. You will not get a response after
this command, but to know what state your le is in, you can run the
git status command.
<h3><b>How to commit files in Git</b></h3>
The next state for a le after the staged state is the committed
state. To commit our le, we use the git commit -m "first
commit" command.
The first part of the command git commit tells Git that all the les
staged are ready to be committed so it is time to take a snapshot.
The second part -m "first commit" is the commit message. -m is
shorthand for message while the text inside the parenthesis is the
commit message.
After executing this command, you should get a response similar to
this:
Now our le is in the committed state.
<br>
<h2><b>Step 4 – Push the repository to GitHub</b></h2>
After you create the repo, you should be redirected to a page that
tells you how to create a repo locally or push an existing one.
In our case, the project already exists locally so we will use
commands in the "…or push an existing repository from the
command line" section. These are the commands:
<p align="center">
    <div style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;color:azure;background-color:rgb(0, 255, 200)">
        git remote add origin https://github.com/ihechikara/git-and-githu
        <br>git branch -M main git push -u origin main.
        <br>The rst command git remote add origin
        https://github.com/ihechikara/git-and-github-tutorial.git
        creates a connection between your local repo and the remote repo
        on Github.
        The URL for your remote project should be entirely different from
        the one above. So to follow along, make sure you are following the
        steps and working with your own remote repo. You won't usually
        get a response after executing this command but make sure you
        have an internet connection.
        <br><br>
        The second command git branch -M main changes your main
        branch's name to "main". The default branch might be created as
        "master", but"main"is the standard name for this repo now. There is
        usually no response here.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p align="center">git push</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        To help you deepen your understanding of le stages, I will make
changes to the le and then push the new version to GitHub.
Recall that our le is now in the committed state. Let's make
changes to the le and take note of the states.
I am going to add a new task to the to-do list:
<br>
    <div style="background-color:darkcyan">
        MY TO-DO LIST
        <ol>
            <li> Write an article.</li>
            <li> Code.</li>
            <li>Study books.</li>
            <li> Attend classes on time.</li>
            <li> Visit aunt.</li>
            <li> Apply for remote jobs. </li>
            <li> Practice code</li>
         </ol>
       </div>
</div>
After adding the new task, run the git status command. This is
what you should see:
<br>
<br>
<div align="center"> git status</div>
<br>
After making changes to the le, it moved to the modied state –
but it's not yet staged for commit, so you can't push it to GitHub yet.
Now we are going to add (stage) this le and then commit and push
it. This is the same as in the last section.
<br>
We rst add the le by using git add . which adds all the les in
the folder (one le in our case). Then we commit the le by running
git commit -m "added new task" followed by git push -u origin
main .
Those are the three steps to pushing your modied les to GitHub.
You add, commit, and then push. I hope you now understand le
stages and the commands associated with them.
<br>
<br>
<p style="text: size 50px;">
    <h2><b>How to Use Branches in Git</b></h2>
    </p>
    With branches, you can create a copy of a le you would like to work
on without messing up the original copy. You can either merge these
changes to the original copy or just let the branch remain
independent.
<br>
Before we go into using branches, I want to show you a visual
representation of our repo which looks like this:
<br>
<p align="center">main banch</p>
<br>
<br>
The image above shows our main branch with the last two commits
(the rst commit and the added new task commit).
At this point, I want to add more tasks to the list but I am not yet
sure whether I want them on my main list. So I will create a new I will break it down.
<br>
checkout tells Git it is supposed to switch to a new branch. -b tells
Git to create a new branch. test is the name of the branch to be
created and switched to. Here is the response you should get:
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">git checkout -b</p>
<br>
Now that we have a new branch created, this is what our repo will
look like:
<br>
<p align="center">git branch</p>
We created the new branch from the state of our last commit. Let's
now add more tasks to this new branch.
<br>
<div style="background-color:cyan">
    MY TO-DO LIST
    <ol>
        <li> Write an article.</li>
        <li> Code.</li>
        <li>Study books.</li>
        <li> Attend classes on time.</li>
        <li>Visit aunt.</li>
        <li> Apply for remote jobs. </li>
        <li> Practice code</li>
        <li> Complete internship task.</li>
        <li> Practice chess openings.</li>
        <li> Solve chess puzzles.</li>
        <li> Check exam schedule. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    into details about how to do this as we did it twice in the last
section.
<br>
You should try doing it yourself so you understand how it works. As
a hint, add the le and then commit with a message (refer to the
previous section for details showing you how to do that).
After committing your test branch, switch back to the main branch
by running this command: git checkout main .
Did you notice that we did not add -b ? This is because we are not
creating a new branch but rather switching to an existing one. You
can check all the branches that exist in your repo by running the git
branch command.
Now we can merge the changes we made in the test branch into the
main branch by running git merge test . At this point, you will see
all the changes made in the test branch reected on the main
branch. You should also receive a response similar to this:
<p align="center">git merge</p>
<br>
Here is a visual representation of our repo:
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">git merge</p>
<br>
<br>
If you go on to push your repo to GitHub, you'll see that the test
branch will not be pushed. It will only remain in your local repo. If
<p style="font-size: ;50px"><h2><b> How to Pull a Repository in Git</b></h2></p>
<br>
<br>
To pull in Git means to clone a remote repository's current state
into your computer/repository. This comes in handy when you want
to work on your repo from a different computer or when you are
contributing to an open source project online.
To test this, don't worry about switching to a new computer. Just
run cd .. to leave the current directory and go back one step. In
my own case, I have navigated back to my desktop.
Go to GitHub, and on your repository's main page you should see a
green button that says "Code". When you click on the button, you
should see some options in a dropdown menu. Go on and copy the
HTTPS URL.
After that, run git clone YOUR_HTTPS_URL . This command pulls the
remote repository into your local computer in a folder called gitand-git-tutorial. That is:
<p align="center">git clone</p>
<br>
