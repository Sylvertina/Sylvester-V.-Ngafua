       <h1 align="center">Definition and Examples of Subjunctive Mood in English</h1>  
In English grammar, the subjunctive mood represents a verb expressing wishes, stipulating demands, or making statements contrary to fact. The word subjunctive comes from the Latin word "subjugate" meaning to subjoin, bind, or subordinate. 
The present subjunctive is the bare form of a verb or a verb with no prefix or suffix. It does not show agreement with its subject. (Example: "I strongly recommend that he retire.") There are two patterns of the present subjunctive: 
	<div style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;color:darkgreen">
        <ul type="circle">
   <li>Formulaic Subjunctive </li>
	<li>Mandative Subjunctive </li>
</ul>
</div>
The formulaic subjunctive is often seen in idioms and other types of figurative language and 
The mandative subjunctive is often seen in expressions 
The only distinctive form of the "past" subjunctive is the words were. It is used with singular subjects in conditional sentences and with the subordinating conjunctions as if and as though. 
(Example: "I love him as if he were my son.") 
<h1 align="center">Guidelines for Using the Subjunctive </h1>
<h2><i><b>The subjunctive may be used in the following circumstances in speech and writing.</b></i></h2> 
<div style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;color:hsl(103, 100%, 50%);background-color: grey;">
    <ol type="1">
<li>	Contrary-to-fact clauses beginning with if</li>
"If I were two-faced, would I be wearing this one?" (Abraham Lincoln)
<li>	Contrary-to-fact clauses expressing a wish:</li>
"At that moment, I had the most desperate wish that she were dead."
(Harrison Ford as Rusty Sabich in Presumed Innocent, 1990)
<li>	That clause after verbs making commands or requests (including ask, demand, insist, propose, request, and suggest):</li>
"I demand that he leave at once."
<li>	Statements of necessity:</li>
"It's necessary that she be in the room with you."
<li> Fixed expressions that remain in their original form or close to it:
as it were, be that as it may, far be it from me, heaven forbid, if need be, so be it, suffice it to say
It is worth noting that the subjunctive mood is used less frequently in informal settings than in formal ones. For example, it is arguably more
common to hear someone say "If I was you" than to hear them say "If I were you. . In many instances, the indicative mood has come to replace 
the subjunctive. Because it is difficult to use the subjunctive correctly in informal speech and even writing in the context of modern English,
 many scholars agree that this mood has run its course.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>"As with the misuse of whom instead of who ... using the subjunctive wrongly is worse than not using it all, and will make you look pompous 
    and silly," (Marsh and Hodsdon, 2010).</li>
<li>	"The subjunctive mood is in its death throes, and the best thing to do is put it out of its misery as soon as possible," (Maugham 1949).</li>
</ul>
<h2 align="center"><b>THE WHERE SUBJUNCTIVE</b></h2>
The were subjunctive essentially occupies its own category within this mood due to how often the verb is found in the subjunctive mood and how closely it has come to represent the form. As the following scholars explain, the were subjunctive refers to nonreal scenarios—when used properly—and is today often replaced with a combination of the past tense "would" and the auxiliary "be." 
<ul type="circle">
<li>	"Teachers call this by a formidable word, subjunctive, meaning lacking in reality. What it refers to is actually the Fairy Tale Syndrome.
 If I were a rich man, could be such a mood. It refers to something that is not possible. If the possibility exists, the sentence would read:
  If I was a rich man," (Dumond 2012).</li>

<li>	"Unlike the mandative subjunctive, the were-subjunctive in counterfactual if-clauses is a recessive feature of standard written English. It is not being replaced by a modal but, instead, by indicative was. Would + be instead of were in counterfactual if-clauses is still largely confined to informal, spoken English. It is meeting with strong prescriptive reaction, especially in the US. One side-effect of this, so to speak, is hypercorrect use of were in non-counterfactuals," (Leech et al., 2012).
